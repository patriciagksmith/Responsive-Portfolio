      <img src="assets/images/me.png" class="auth-image" alt="Patricia Smith">

      <p>I am a wife, a parent, a grandparent and a web-designer, by trade. I was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States as a child. After moving to this country, I grew up on the east coast, in Cape Cod, Long Island and Connecticut. I love spending time with my family, including my big dog, Rocky and have always enjoyed my career in the design field. In my spare time I enjoy traveling, cooking and being outdoors. I love to learn knew things and am looking forward to adding web development to my list of skills.</p>

      <p>I started my career as a typesetter and then a graphic designer. I am mostly self-taught, but I have had the opportunity to work for a few great companies that supported my quest to learn new skills.</p>
